# Uber-NewYork-Data-Analysis

This project is based on the data collected from kaggle on uber new york.I had retrieved and cleaned the data by using python.I had then analysed the data on various factors such as number of pickups per month,number of pickups per week from january to june.I had used point plots from seaborn package to analyse the number of pickups for each day of the week at the selected time of the day.The plots were interesting and insightful.I had learnt about box plots and violin plots and how to deploy them using plotly and chart studio.I had worked on the folium package to create a heatmap,showing the traffic of uber pickups on the Newyork city map.Lastly, I had plotted a pivot table based on the pickups for the respective day and time and deployed a python function to automate the creation of the pivot table for all the datasets.
