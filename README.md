# Uber-NewYork-Data-Analysis

This project is based on the data collected from kaggle on uber new york.I had retrieved and cleaned the data by using python code.I had then analysed the data on various factors such as number of pickups per month,number of pickups per week from january to june.I had used point plots from seaborn package to analyse the number of pickups for each day of the week at the selected time of the day.The plots were interesting and insightful.
